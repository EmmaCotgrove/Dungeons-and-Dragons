This program has two main abilties: Encounters and Player Information

- The encounters option enables a Dungeon Master (DM) of the game Dungeons and Dragons to put in the number of monsters and the XP to work out the monster rating. It allows to enter the number of players along with their player level. With this information it works out what type of encounter it is using the text file as reference. This text file contains the data obtained from the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook 5th Edition.
