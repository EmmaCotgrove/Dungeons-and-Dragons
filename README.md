- The encounters option enables a Dungeon Master (DM) of the game Dungeons and Dragons to put in the number of monsters and the XP to work out the monster rating.

 - The Player information takes note of the players name, their character name and their max health and stores this in a file for the
 DM to refer to in future 

- The Initiative Track enables the DM to track what is happening during combat. It allows entry of updated player information including
 what the player has rolled for their initiative. It then places the players in order for the DM. At the end of each turn the End Turn
 button pressed will update the list and place the player at the top to the bottom and move each other one up. It also enables the DM
 to edit details such as health of a player when they take damage.


Expansions to the code to be completed:
To read in the previous saved characters information
To add more details such as race and class of the players characters for the DM to store.
